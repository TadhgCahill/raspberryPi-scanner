This project is an implementation of STEMMA sensors on the Raspberry Pi Zero to display environmental data such as; local temperature, 
humidity, barometric pressure, and direction of the nearest strong magnetic field.
this project was inspired by the video saveitforparts of a similar premise but did so using different components. 
parts:
Raspberry Pi Zero
Adafruit Mini PiTFT
Adafruit BME688 - Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Gas Sensor
Adafruit TLV493D Triple-Axis Magnetometer
basic powerbank

on boot the scanner begins the program, displaying all reading, and can be shut down by pressing both buttons at the same time.
